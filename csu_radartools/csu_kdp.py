    Overview
    --------
    This is an old algorithm that uses an FIR filter to process differential
    phase and extract specific differential phase. It works on polarimetric
    radar data. It is based on code provided by V. N. Bringi and Yanting Wang
    of CSU Electrical Engineering. It assumes differential phase has been
    unfolded already. You can send this function either 1D or 2D arrays of
    data. If 2D, it assumes the first index is azimuth so it will loop over
    that, calculating KDP along individual rays.

    Steps
    -----
    1. Standard deviation of differential phase is calculated and used to
       QC the phase data. The stdev calculation uses up to std_gate consecutive
       gates regardless of gate spacing.
    2. Differential phase is filtered using the FIR filter, which has been
       tuned to the number of gates contained within the FIR window. This
       algorithm only works for window / gate spacing = even number.
    3. Specific differential phase is calculated by consulting reflectivity.
       As reflectivity declines progressively more and more gates are needed
       in the window used to fit a line to the filtered phase. Specific
       differential phase is half the slope of that line.

    Arguments
    ---------
    dp = Differential phase (deg, 1D or 2D array)
    dz = Reflectivity (dBZ, 1D or 2D array)
    rng = Range (km, 1D or 2D array -
          use np.meshgrid() first tp make rng 2D if needed)
    thsd = Threshold for standard deviation of differential phase, above which
           the data are not considered when filtering or calculating specific
           differential phase. The user can specify a 1D vector of spatially
           varying thresholds instead (i.e., vary by range).
    nfilter = Number of times to apply the FIR filter
    bad = Value for bad/missing data
    gs = Gate spacing of radar (meters)
    window = Changes window over which FIR filter is applied (km). Also affects
             the width of the adaptive KDP calculations.
    std_gate = Number of gates for standard deviation of phase calculation.
               Must be odd or function will just set it to the default value.

    Returns
    -------
    kd_lin = Specific differential phase (deg/km, 1D or 2D array)
    dp_lin = Filtered differential phase (deg, 1D or 2D array)
